# Mandelbrot-Set-Visualization
## A visualization of the Mandelbrot Set
Compiling and executing MandelbrotSet.java creates a JFrame pop-up window that shows the visualization of the famous Mandelbrot Set fractal.

Clicking on any point in the frame sets that point as the center of the window, and the zoom button... well... zooms in.
